## Problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Pseudocode
```
define function 'compute' with no inputs
    initialise variable 'sum' to zero
    initialise variable 'f1' to 1
    initialise variable 'f2' to 2

    loop until 'f1' is 4000000
        if 'f1' is divisible by 2 add 'f1' to 'sum' 
	otherwise make 'f1' equal to 'f2' and 'f2' equal to 'f1' + 'f2'
    
    return 'sum' from function

call function 'compute' and print it
```
